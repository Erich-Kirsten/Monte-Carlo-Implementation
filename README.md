Performance Comparison
The performance of the serial and parallel implementations is compared based on the time taken to
estimate Ï€ for varying numbers of random points (n).

Conclusion
The parallel implementation of the Monte Carlo method using OpenMP demonstrates significant
performance improvements over the serial implementation, especially as the number of points
increases. By leveraging multi-core processors, the parallel approach achieves faster computation times
and better efficiency. This comparison highlights the advantages of parallel processing in computational
tasks and the potential for further optimizations in Monte Carlo simulations
